# CTPF Research Harness — Agent Context

**Repository-local instructions for Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents.** This `AGENTS.md`
is the sole repository-local agent-instruction surface. Do not create a parallel `CLAUDE.md`,
tool-specific rule set, or other second agent-instruction file.

CTPF is an evidence-first research project for Capability Trust Propagation Failure (CTPF).
The `ctpf` PyPI package and CLI are its reference research harness, not the project identity.
Private project governance is maintained outside this repository. For vault-governed work, read
`CTPF/Project Instructions.md` beneath the operator-configured `CTPF_VAULT_ROOT`. If that location
is unavailable, stop and request it from the operator. Current gates live in the active plan and
`Boards/*`. When sequence changes, update those private governance surfaces (`Project-Status.md`
only on milestones or clear staleness). Do not invent a parallel roadmap inside the repo.

## Critical Context

This is a **security research tool**. Some offensive-looking patterns are intentional:
payload generation, injection techniques, malicious MCP server behavior, and related
research logic are part of the product. Do not "fix" those patterns unless explicitly
instructed.

## Security Constraints

These are product invariants, not preferences.

- **Local HTTP binding:** Any CTPF-owned local HTTP server or proxy adapter binds to
  `127.0.0.1` only. Never bind to `0.0.0.0` or external interfaces.
- **API key storage:** API keys go in the OS keyring only. Never store keys in config files,
  environment variables, or source code.

## Operating Mode

- Default to **outcome-driven builder mode**.
- A request to build, change, or fix something authorizes normal scoped work: inspect the relevant
  files, create a feature branch when required, edit source/tests/docs, refactor, run proportionate
  validation, commit, push, and open or update a PR.
- Work continuously through those implementation steps. Do not require approval for each edit,
  test, fix, commit, or other intermediate action.
- Stop and ask only when:
  - a missing decision would materially change requested behavior or scope
  - an action is destructive or difficult to reverse
  - a dependency, workflow, version, release, public API, or repository structure would change
  - paid inference, credentials, a live target, or external side effects are involved
  - merge, release, publication, or scientific adjudication is required
- Assess reviewer feedback point by point. Address valid in-scope feedback autonomously; ask only
  when it expands scope or changes an approved design.
- Verify before claiming. Do not describe repo behavior or implementation state from memory.
- Interpret instructions literally, but make reasonable implementation decisions within the
  requested scope instead of escalating routine details.

## Hard Boundaries

- Routine build, change, and fix requests authorize work through a ready PR unless the developer
  says to keep the work local. Merge, release, and publication remain explicit approval boundaries.
- Do not add dependencies without explicit approval.
- Do not install extra CLI tools (`gh`, `hub`, etc.).
- Do not write transient plan/spec/session files into the repo.
  Use the OS temp directory if a scratch file is required.
- Research findings, run evidence, session logs, evidence bundles, analysis notes, and
  publication drafts belong in the operator-configured private research workspace beneath
  `CTPF_VAULT_ROOT`, never in this repository.
  The repository contains tool source, tests, synthetic fixtures, schemas, and tool docs.
- Never create files in: `plans/*`, `design_docs/*`, `*/.plan`, `docs/superpowers/*`
- Only write files to standard repo locations (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`) or paths named
  in the task brief.
- Do not restore removed legacy product packages (`server`, `assist`, `rxp`, `chain`,
  `orchestrator`, `imports`, `ipi`, `cxp`, `inject`) without explicit instruction.
- Keep demonstrated fixtures narrow and colocated with their CTPF scenario or test. Do not
  recreate the removed fixture-library packages or a generic fixture hierarchy without
  demonstrated need and explicit instruction.

## Do Not Modify Unless Explicitly Instructed

- `pyproject.toml` version, dependencies, or build config
- `.github/workflows/`
- `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- module/repo structure or module names (except when an approved change explicitly removes
  or freezes named modules)
- intentional offensive security research behavior

## Tech Stack

- Python >= 3.11
- Package manager: `uv` (PEP 735 groups — sync with `uv sync --group dev`)
- Database: SQLite (`~/.ctpf/ctpf.db`)
- CLI: Typer
- MCP: official SDK (async-native)
- Lint/format: ruff (line length 100)
- Type check: mypy
- Tests: pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-timeout
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Code Quality Rules

These rules exist to prevent recurring bugs. Follow them exactly.

- **Function size:** Max 50 lines of logic (excluding docstring). Decompose if longer.
- **Guard clauses:** Return/raise early on error conditions. Do not nest the happy path.
- **No magic values:** Define constants at module level or use enums.
- **Parameterized SQL:** Always use `?` placeholders. Never interpolate values into SQL strings.
- **Empty collection guard:** Check if a collection is empty before using it in SQL `IN (...)`
  or iteration.
- **Context managers:** Use `with` for file handles, DB connections, and anything requiring cleanup.
- **Don't suppress errors silently:** If catching an exception to continue, log it or comment why.
- **Max 3 levels of indentation** inside a function body. Prefer composition over nesting.
- **External input defense:** When parsing external/untrusted data (JSON from files, tool output,
  API responses):
  - After `json.loads`, check `isinstance(result, dict)` before calling `.get()`
  - Coerce numeric fields with try/except before arithmetic
  - Wrap per-record processing in try/except that appends warnings instead of crashing
  - Never pass a potentially empty string to `json.loads` without guarding
  - Warn and skip malformed records — never crash the import

## Coding Standards

- Google-style docstrings on all public functions and classes
- Type hints required on all public function signatures
- Use `pathlib.Path` for all file paths
- Use subprocess list form; avoid `shell=True` unless explicitly unavoidable
- Async: MCP SDK is async-native. Use `async/await` for MCP interactions.

## Repo Layout

```

After an approved change removes packages, treat them as gone — do not restore them without
explicit instruction.

## Core Commands

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/ctpf/
ctpf --help
```

Without `--group dev`, dev dependencies get stripped.

## Git Workflow

- Feature branches required for code changes (`feature/*`, `fix/*`)
- Doc and config-only changes may be pushed directly to `main` when the developer asks
- Before editing code, check branch with `git branch --show-current`
- If on `main`, create/switch to a feature or fix branch first (for code changes)
- End of session: commit, stash, or discard; never leave uncommitted changes
- A routine build, change, or fix request includes pushing the feature branch and opening or
  updating a ready PR. Do not merge without explicit authorization.

### Shell quoting for commits

- Git Bash / POSIX: `git commit -m "..."` is fine for multi-line messages.
- PowerShell / CMD: prefer `git commit -F <file>` (temp message file). Avoid fragile
  multi-line `-m` quoting under Windows shells.

## Validation

During implementation, run focused tests and checks for changed code.

Before opening or updating a PR, run validation proportionate to the change. Run the complete
standard suite for broad shared-code changes, releases, build/workflow changes, or when requested:

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy src/ctpf/ && uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Smoke test the CLI when CLI behavior changes:

```bash
ctpf --help
```

Test scope:

- Follow the task brief exactly if it specifies tests
- Otherwise default to scoped tests for changed code

## Failure / Timeout Policy

- If verification fails and you cannot resolve it in 2 attempts, stop spinning and report
  what failed (commit the work to the branch if that was the agreed failure policy)
- If a test run exceeds 30 seconds, stop and identify the stuck test
- Do not increase timeouts and wait longer — diagnose instead
- Kill orphaned Python/Node processes before rerunning tests if needed

## Legal / Ethical

- Only test systems you own, control, or are explicitly authorized to test
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Frame the tooling as defensive security testing tooling
