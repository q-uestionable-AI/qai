"""Path helpers for the q-ai data directory.

The ``~/.qai/`` directory stores the SQLite database, framework cache,
bridge token, managed listener state files, and IPI evidence. Because
these contain captured request bodies, headers, and scoring data that
may include sensitive values, the helper here centralizes creation of
that directory so it is born with permissions ``0o700`` on POSIX.

Sites that only *compute* a ``Path.home() / ".qai" / ...`` sub-path —
without materializing a directory — do not need this helper. Only
sites that actually call ``mkdir`` on ``~/.qai/`` or a child directory
import from here.

Windows ACL management at the Python level is fragile, so on Windows
the helper creates the directory and returns; default NTFS ACLs apply.
See ``SECURITY.md`` (``## Evidence at Rest``) for the access boundary.
